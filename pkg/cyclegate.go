// CycleGate enforces "exactly one poll cycle at a time" across the interval
// loop and the forced-cycle HTTP endpoint. It is non-blocking by design: a
// caller that cannot acquire the slot backs off instead of queueing, so a
// burst of forced-cycle requests cannot pile up behind a slow cycle.

	// TryAcquire reports whether the caller now holds the single cycle slot.
	// A caller that receives true MUST call Release when its cycle finishes.
	TryAcquire() bool
	// Release frees the slot. Calling Release without holding it is a no-op.
	Release()
